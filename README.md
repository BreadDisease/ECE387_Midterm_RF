# ECE 387 - RF Transmitter and Receiver

This is my ECE 387 Midterm Presentation on Radio Frequency Transmitters and Receivers.

There are two code files:
  1. ECE387_Transmitter.ino
  2. ECE387_Receiver.ino

These files contain the transmitter and receiver code respectively. 

A circuit diagram can be found under 
  /Presentation_Materials/Transmitter_Circuit.jpg
  /Presentation_Materials/Receiver_Circuit.jpg

The RadioHead folder contains the RadioHead library developed by Mike M. at AirSpayce
